## Overview

This project, **graphGita**, is the first modern re-interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita that utilizes **Knowledge Graphs** for accurate query retrieval and qunatify philosphical aspects to serve specific problem-solution needs. **_The ambitious goal is to incorporate over 10 versions of Gita interpretations_** written from time-to-time by different past and present scholars and integrate them in form of a sophisticated Knowledge Graph aided with modern retrieval technologies such as Monte Carlo Tree Search, and KG-RAG to provide a seamless multi-modal experience (text, image and video) to users. My primary goal is to increase readers' comprehension of philosophical ideas while offering pertinent perspectives for modern readers. Based on the literature reviews of each of the 18 chapters and how they relate to one another, the text is formatted into a graph structure. This structure may grow more sophisticated and complex with due course of time as the project progresses.




### Why Graph the Bhagvad Gita to Re-Understand it in Modern Times ?

There is a significant need to reinterpret ancient texts like the Bhagavad Gita in today's context. The teachings offer valuable perspectives on ethics, human behavior, and spirituality that remain applicable. However, traditional formats often fail to engage modern readers effectively. Advanced technologies, including knowledge graphs and machine learning, can make the wisdom of the Gita more accessible and relevant.

### Key Features

- **Knowledge Graph**: A structured representation of the Gita's text that highlights relationships between chapters, shlokas, characters, and themes.
- **Mathematical Analysis**: Uses mathematical techniques to analyze and interpret the teachings of the Gita.
- **Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG with MCTS)**: Knowledge Graph RAG with Monte Carlo Tree Search allows users to retrieve relevant information based on their queries.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Facilitates interactive exploration of the text, enabling non-linear engagement with the material.

## Problem Statement

### Why is this Project Required?

The Bhagavad Gita presents challenges for modern readers:

- **Complexity of Concepts**: The ideas within the Gita can be difficult to understand without contextual support or visual aids.
- **Linear Structure**: Traditional readings follow a linear narrative that may obscure important relationships between different teachings.
- **Lack of Interactivity**: Static texts do not engage readers in an interactive manner.

### Why Graph the Gita?

The Bhagavad Gita, while profound in its teachings, can be challenging to navigate and understand in its traditional linear format. By representing it as a knowledge graph:

1. **Non-Linear Navigation**: Readers can explore connections between concepts across different chapters
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Related verses and themes can be easily discovered regardless of their location in the text
3. **Modern Accessibility**: Complex philosophical concepts become more approachable through visual and interactive representations
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Mathematical analysis reveals structural patterns and thematic relationships that might not be apparent in linear reading
5. **Personalized Learning**: MCTS-powered exploration allows readers to follow paths most relevant to their interests and questions

This graphical representation transforms the ancient text into a dynamic knowledge base that preserves its authenticity while making it more accessible to modern readers.

### Limitations of Existing Texts

Readers today may encounter:

- **Interpretation Variability**: Different translations can lead to confusion regarding core messages.
- **Contextual Relevance**: The teachings may seem disconnected from modern life challenges without clear connections to contemporary issues.
